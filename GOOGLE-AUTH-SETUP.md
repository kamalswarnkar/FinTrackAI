# Google Authentication Setup

## ✅ Success! Google Authentication is Working

You've successfully set up Google authentication for your application. Here's what you need to know:

### How It Works

1. User clicks "Continue with Google" on the login page
2. User is redirected to Google's authentication page
3. After signing in, Google redirects back to your application
4. Your backend creates/updates the user and generates a JWT token
5. User is redirected to the dashboard with the token

### What's Already Set Up

- ✅ Google OAuth client ID and secret in `.env`
- ✅ Backend routes for Google authentication
- ✅ Frontend components for handling the authentication flow
- ✅ User model with Google ID support

### For Production Deployment

When deploying to production:

1. Update Google Cloud Console with production URLs:
   - Authorized JavaScript origins: `https://your-domain.com`
   - Authorized redirect URIs: `https://your-api-domain.com/api/auth/google/callback`

2. Update environment variables:
   ```
   FRONTEND_URL=https://your-domain.com
   API_BASE_URL=https://your-api-domain.com
   ```

### Testing

You can test Google authentication using:

1. The test server: `node test-server.js`
2. The test page: `http://localhost:8000/test-login.html`

Or directly through your main application by clicking "Continue with Google" on the login page.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check that the redirect URI in Google Cloud Console matches exactly what's in your code
2. Verify that your Google Cloud project is published or your email is added as a test user
3. Check server logs for any errors
4. Run `node verify-google-auth.js` to verify your configuration
